However, how to ensure that the update is secure? \n\nOne way to put a security (and quality) control check before accepting an update is to check what part of the code changes have passed through a code review process. DepDive automates this check.\n\n\nWorkflow\n--------\n\nDepDive maps code changes between two versions of a package uploaded in the registry to the corresponding commits that made these changes in the package\'s \nsource code repository. DepDive then identifies if there was a code reviewer for the mapped commits through rule-based checks for evidences of code review on GitHub.\n\nAlong the process, DepDive also outputs phantom artifacts, that is, files and lines that are present in the registry, but not present in the repository. Example of phantom files can be compiles binaries in PyPI packages, transpiled JavaScript in npm, and other auto-generated files. Not to mention, malicious actors can sneak in code in the last mile between the repository and the registry. \n\nDepDive works for four package registries: (1) Crates.io (Rust), (2) npm (JavaScript), (3) PyPI (Python), (4) RubyGems (Ruby).\nCurrently, DepDive only works for GitHub repositories, as GitHub is our primary source to check for code-review. \n\n\n.. image:: docs/images/depdive.drawio.png\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n* Outputs changes that have been code reviewed and that have not in a depednency update. You can calculate the code reviewe coverage from the output by diving the revewed lines of code changes by the total lines of code of changes in an update.\n* Outputs the reviewed and non-reviewed commits, and how we determined if a commit was code-reviewed, and the actors involved in the review.\n* Outputs files that are present in the update version downloaded from the registry, but not in the repository.\n* Updates lines of code changes that are present in the udpate, but cannot be mapped to changes in the repository.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install *depdive* via pip_ from PyPI_:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   $ pip install depdive\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    ca = CodeReviewAnalysis(CARGO, "tokio", "1.8.4", "1.9.0")\n    stats = ca.stats\n    assert stats.phantom_files == 0\n    assert stats.files_with_phantom_lines == 0\n    assert stats.phantom_lines == 0\n    assert stats.reviewed_lines == 3694\n    assert stats.non_reviewed_lines == 0\n    assert stats.total_commit_count == 29\n    assert stats.reviewed_commit_count == 29\n    \n    ca = CodeReviewAnalysis(RUBYGEMS, "pundit", "2.1.0", "2.1.1")\n    stats = ca.stats\n    assert stats.phantom_files == 0\n    assert stats.files_with_phantom_lines == 0\n    assert stats.phantom_lines == 0\n    assert stats.reviewed_lines == 128\n    assert stats.non_reviewed_lines == 186\n    assert stats.total_commit_count == 35\n    assert stats.reviewed_commit_count == 23\n    \n    ca = CodeReviewAnalysis(PYPI, "numpy", "1.21.4", "1.21.5")\n    stats = ca.stats\n    assert stats.phantom_files == 39\n    assert stats.files_with_phantom_lines == 1\n    assert stats.phantom_lines == 3\n    assert stats.reviewed_lines == 245\n    assert stats.non_reviewed_lines == 12\n    assert stats.total_commit_count == 10\n    assert stats.reviewed_commit_count == 9\n    \n    ca = CodeReviewAnalysis(NPM, "lodash", "4.17.20", "4.17.21")\n    stats = ca.stats\n    assert stats.phantom_files == 1046\n    assert stats.files_with_phantom_lines == 1\n    assert stats.phantom_lines == 1\n    assert stats.reviewed_lines == 58\n    assert stats.non_reviewed_lines == 14\n    assert stats.total_commit_count == 3\n    assert stats.reviewed_commit_count == 2\n    \n\nFuture Work\n------------\n\n* Also provides quality of the code review (e.g. what is the relation between the author and the reviewer? Was a sock account used to bypass code review check?)\n* What other checks should we perform for an update?\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis package was created with cookietemple_ using Cookiecutter_ based on Hypermodern_Python_Cookiecutter_.\n\n.. _cookietemple: https://cookietemple.com\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n.. _Hypermodern_Python_Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/\n.. _Usage: https://depdive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n',
