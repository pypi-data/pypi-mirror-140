# # ðŸ¥­ Datetimes
#
# This file contains a few useful datetime functions.
#
# They exist solely to make clear what is being used when called. There are 2 general cases:
# 1. Logging/time tracking/user output - local time is what should be used.
# 2. Comparison with dates stored on-chain - UTC should be used.
#
# Getting a UTC time that is comparable with on-chain datetimes isn't intuitive, so putting
# it in one place and using that consistently should make it clearer in the calling code
# what is going on, without the unnecessary complications.
#


def local_now() -> datetime:
    return datetime.now()


# Getting a comparable UTC time using this line:
#   return datetime.utcnow().astimezone(timezone.utc)
# seems to cause `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` on Windows (but is fine on Mac and
# Linux). Best to avoid it and use the following instead, which seems to work consistently
# on Windows as well as Mac and Linux.
def utc_now() -> datetime:
    return datetime.utcnow().replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc)
