bomcheck.cfg is a file you can use to make configuration adjustments to to suit
your needs.  Let the bomcheck program know where the file is located by setting
the location in bomcheck, or if you're using bomcheckgui, set the location 
there.

bomcheck.cfg can be edited with a text editor program like notepad or wordpad.
Wordpad is preferrered because it tends to handle end-of-line characters
properly (lines don't run off the screen).
