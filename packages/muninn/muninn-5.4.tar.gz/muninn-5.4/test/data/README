This site is a repository for old Debian releases. For new releases
please see http://ftp.debian.org/debian/.

Look at the individual directories README file for more information.

Note about backports:
---------------------

Backports until squeeze were hosted by an external service. They are
archived in the backports.org/ directory. From wheezy on you can find
their archived contents in the Debian archive structure debian/.


Note about renamed files:
-------------------------

Note that we had to rename two files during the archival of the
squeeze release, as they had changed between the old version stored in
the Debian archive and the version in squeeze.

The files are

pool/main/c/cl-md5/cl-md5_1.8.5.orig.tar.gz
pool/main/p/python-pam/python-pam_0.4.2.orig.tar.gz

and the old versions have been renamed, getting a suffix of ".old".
Unfortunately this destroys the possibility to fetch them
automatically using apt or any tool using the Sources index - if you
need those two, you will have to manually fetch them.
