        ## What is TOPSIS
        
        **T**echnique for **O**rder **P**reference by **S**imilarity to **I**deal
        **S**olution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision
        making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance
        from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal
        solution. More details at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPSIS).
        
        <br>
        
        ## How to use this package:
        
        The Topsis-Bhavya-101903365 has a function topsis() that takes 4 parameters, i.e., inputFile, weights, impacts, and outputFile, and returns the resulting dataframe having **Topsis Score** and **Rank** as additional columns. 
        
        Where,
        
        * **inputFile:** Can be either csv file or pandas dataframe. Input file must contain three or more columns, where, First column is the object/variable name like M1, M2, M3, M4, etc. Also, from 2nd to last columns must contain numeric values only.
        * **weights:** In the form of string having numerical values separated by commas.
        * **impacts:** In the form of string having + or - values separated by commas. Here, + refers to positive impact, whereas, - refers to negative impact.
        * **outputFile** (optional): csv file in which output of the function will be stored.
        
        
        For Example,
        
        ### Method 1: By passing csv file as input
        ```python
        >>> import Topsis_Bhavya_101903365 as t
        >>> inputFile = "input.csv"
        >>> weights = "1,1,1,2,1"
        >>> impacts = "+,+,-,+,+"
        >>> result_df = t.topsis(inputFile, weights, impacts)
        ```
        <br>
        
        ### Method 2: By passing pandas dataframe as input
        ```python
        >>> import Topsis_Bhavya_101903365 as t
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> dataFrame = pd.read_csv("input.csv)
        >>> weights = "1,1,1,2,1"
        >>> impacts = "+,+,-,+,+"
        >>> result_df = t.topsis(dataFrame, weights, impacts)
        ```
        
        <br>
