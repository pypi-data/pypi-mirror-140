# We differentiate here between the generic Links Nodes and Turns object and more
# specialized objects that inherit from these classes Dynamic Traffic Assignment
# algorithms all use a base line of attributes that are kept in these baseline
# classes Algorithms like LTM need additional attributes - these are kept in objects
# that inherit from their respective class, so LTM has a special class for its links
# to store things like cvn .. the source code for the baseline classes is replicated
# both in jitclass decorated and undecorated (uncompiled) form because inheritance
# otherwise does not work at this point,
# see https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/1694 . adding a new assignment algorithm
# to this is meant to be made simpler this way, nothing changes in the assignment
# object one simply needs to define new extending network, turn, node and link
# objects as needed and write a setup file, as shown for i-ltm.
