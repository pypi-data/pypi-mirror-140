These docs are built from the\n[`docs` branch](https://github.com/dhruvkb/pls/tree/docs) in the same\nrepository, so contributions to the docs are most welcome.\n\n---\n\nðŸš§ Everything below this line will eventually be transferred to the\n[documentation](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls).\n\n## Features\n\n`pls` provides many features over  `ls` command. `pls` can:\n\n- show Nerd Font icons or emoji next to files and directories making it easier to read the output\n- colour output to elevate important files or dim unimportant ones\n- use a more nuanced approach to hidden files than plainly hiding files with a leading dot `.`\n- group directories and shows them all before files\n- ignore leading dots `.` and normalise case when sorting files\n- align files names by first character\n- show technical two-letter Git status for files and directories\n- cascade formatting rule specs by based on specificity levels\n- read [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) files from the directory to augment its configuration\n- show more details like permissions, owner and size in columns\n- link files and hide derived files behind the main ones\n\nThe icon, color and most behaviour in the application can be [configured using plain-text YAML files](src/pls/data/README.md) for the pros who prefer to tweak their tools.\n\n## Upcoming features\n\nIn the future `pls` will be able to\n\n- generate visibility rules by parsing `.gitignore`\n- add MIME type as another method for matching files to specs\n- use complete path based matching for files\n- generate tree-like output for subdirectories\n\nIf you want to help implement any of these features, feel free to submit a PR. `pls` is free and open-source software.\n\n## Comparison with similar tools\n\nThere are a lot of `ls` replacements. Here are some of the most popular ones.\n\n- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)\n- [`lsd`](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)\n- [`colorls`](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)\n- [`ls-go`](https://github.com/acarl005/ls-go)\n\n`pls` aims to stand out because of some very specific choices.\n\n- Does not intend to replace `ls`. `pls`, as a command, is just as easy to type.\n- Targets a more tech-savvy audience in its [features](#features).\n- Intelligently [maps file type](src/pls/data/README.md). Just comparing the file extension would be too generic.\n- Meticulously chosen iconography for the appreciating eyes.\n- Highly customisable at a project level using a simple [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) file.\n- Built in a friendly language, Python. This makes it easy to fork and change it yourself.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get the best of `pls`, [install a Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md#font-installation) on your computer. [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) come patched with many icons from different popular icon sets. If you\'re a "pro" (the target audience for `pls`) these fonts are basically a must.\n\n`pls` is a pure-Python codebase and is deployed to PyPI. So installing it on any system with a supported Python version is quite straightforward.\n\n```shell\n$ python3 -m pip install --user pls\n```\n\nThere are no native packages _yet_.\n\n## Usage\n\n`pls` has a very simple API with easy to memorise flags. There are no mandatory arguments. Just run `pls` anywhere on your disk.\n\n```shell\n$ pls\n```\n\nThere are a few optional arguments and flags you can use to tweak the behaviour. You can see the complete list of arguments and their description by passing the `--help` or `-h` flags.\n\n```shell\n$ pls --help\n```\n\n### Directory\n\nThe only positional argument is a directory. Pass this to see the contents of a different folder rather than the current working directory.\n\n```shell\n$ pls path/to/somewhere/else\n```\n\n### Icons\n\n`pls` supports many icons for popular languages out of the box and will show icons by default. If you don\'t have a Nerd Font (why?), you can switch to emoji icons using `--icons emoji` or `-iemoji`. Be warned they are quite bad. If you are a sad person, you turn icons off using `--icon none` or `-inone`.\n\n**Note:** The built-in icon configuration is intentionally lean. The whole idea is for `pls` to be [customisable by you](src/pls/data/README.md).\n\n### Filtering\n\nYou can choose to hide files or folders from the output using `--no-files` and `--no-dirs` respectively. Passing both will lead to a blank output. On the other hand if you want to see files and directories that `pls` would not show otherwise, pass `--all`.\n\n### Sorting\n\nBy default `pls` will place all directories first, followed by files with both sorted alphabetically from A to Z. You can prevent folders from being first by passing the `--no-dirs-first` flag. You can change the sort to go from Z to A using `--sort desc` or `-sdesc`. Leading dots are ignored during sorting.\n\n### Alignment\n\nA lot of code related files start with a leading dot `.` for no valid reason. `pls` by default\n\n- moves their name left by one character to line up the actual alphabets\n- dims their leading dot\n\nIf you don\'t like this, you can set `--no-align` to turn off all this behaviour in one swoop.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen you need more infomation about your files, pass the `--details` flag. This expands the list into a table, with\n\n- permissions\n- owner name\n- size\n- Git status _(if available)_\n\nadded to the output. The permissions are presented as `rwx` triplets. The size is presented in binary compound-units (the ones with the "i" like "*iB"). You can switch to decimal units by passing `--units decimal` or `-udecimal`. This flag has no effect unless the `--detail` flag is passed too.\n',
