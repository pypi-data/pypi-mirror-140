These docs are built from the\n[`docs` branch](https://github.com/dhruvkb/pls/tree/docs) in the same\nrepository, so contributions to the docs are most welcome.\n\nThe docs contain information on almost everything, including but not limited to\nthe following:\n\n- [installation, updates and usage](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/get_started)\n- [features and CLI options](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/features)\n- [reference](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/reference)\n- [contribution](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/contribution)\n\n---\n\nðŸš§ Everything below this line will eventually be transferred to the\n[documentation](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls).\n\n## Features\n\n`pls` provides many features over  `ls` command. `pls` can:\n\n- show Nerd Font icons or emoji next to files and directories making it easier to read the output\n- colour output to elevate important files or dim unimportant ones\n- use a more nuanced approach to hidden files than plainly hiding files with a leading dot `.`\n- group directories and shows them all before files\n- ignore leading dots `.` and normalise case when sorting files\n- align files names by first character\n- show technical two-letter Git status for files and directories\n- cascade formatting rule specs by based on specificity levels\n- read [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) files from the directory to augment its configuration\n- show more details like permissions, owner and size in columns\n- link files and hide derived files behind the main ones\n\nThe icon, color and most behaviour in the application can be [configured using\nplain-text YAML files](src/pls/data/README.md) for the pros who prefer to tweak\ntheir tools.\n\n## Upcoming features\n\nIn the future `pls` will be able to\n\n- generate visibility rules by parsing `.gitignore`\n- add MIME type as another method for matching files to specs\n- use complete path based matching for files\n- generate tree-like output for subdirectories\n\nIf you want to help implement any of these features, feel free to submit a PR.\n`pls` is free and open-source software.\n\n## Comparison with similar tools\n\nThere are a lot of `ls` replacements. Here are some of the most popular ones.\n\n- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)\n- [`lsd`](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)\n- [`colorls`](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)\n- [`ls-go`](https://github.com/acarl005/ls-go)\n\n`pls` aims to stand out because of some very specific choices.\n\n- Does not intend to replace `ls`. `pls`, as a command, is just as easy to type.\n- Targets a more tech-savvy audience in its [features](#features).\n- Intelligently [maps file type](src/pls/data/README.md). Just comparing the file extension would be too generic.\n- Meticulously chosen iconography for the appreciating eyes.\n- Highly customisable at a project level using a simple [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) file.\n- Built in a friendly language, Python. This makes it easy to fork and change it yourself.\n',
