`pls` is a prettier `ls` for the pros.

The "p" stands for
- pretty (the output from `pls` surely looks better)
- programmer (`pls` is geared towards developers)
- professional (`pls` can be extensively tweaked by the pros)
- Python (`pls` is written in Python!)

Just pick whichever helps you remember the command name.

It works in a manner similar to `ls`, in  that it lists directories and files in
a given directory, but it adds many more
[developer-friendly features](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/features).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that `pls` is not a replacement for `ls`. `ls` is a tried, tested and
trusted command with lots of features. `pls`, on the other hand, is a simple
tool for people who just want to see the contents of their directories.

## Documentation

We have some very beautiful [documentation](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls) over
on our GitHub pages site. These docs are built from the
[`docs` branch](https://github.com/dhruvkb/pls/tree/docs) in the same
repository, so contributions to the docs are most welcome.

The docs contain information on almost everything, including but not limited to
the following:

- [installation, updates and usage](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/get_started)
- [features and CLI options](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/features)
- [reference](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/reference)
- [contribution](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls/contribution)

üöß Everything below this line will eventually be transferred to the
[documentation](https://dhruvkb.github.io/pls).

## Features

`pls` provides many features over  `ls` command. `pls` can:

- show Nerd Font icons or emoji next to files and directories making it easier to read the output
- colour output to elevate important files or dim unimportant ones
- use a more nuanced approach to hidden files than plainly hiding files with a leading dot `.`
- group directories and shows them all before files
- ignore leading dots `.` and normalise case when sorting files
- align files names by first character
- show technical two-letter Git status for files and directories
- cascade formatting rule specs by based on specificity levels
- read [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) files from the directory to augment its configuration
- show more details like permissions, owner and size in columns
- link files and hide derived files behind the main ones

The icon, color and most behaviour in the application can be [configured using
plain-text YAML files](src/pls/data/README.md) for the pros who prefer to tweak
their tools.

## Upcoming features

In the future `pls` will be able to

- generate visibility rules by parsing `.gitignore`
- add MIME type as another method for matching files to specs
- use complete path based matching for files
- generate tree-like output for subdirectories

If you want to help implement any of these features, feel free to submit a PR.
`pls` is free and open-source software.

## Comparison with similar tools

There are a lot of `ls` replacements. Here are some of the most popular ones.

- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- [`lsd`](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd)
- [`colorls`](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls)
- [`ls-go`](https://github.com/acarl005/ls-go)

`pls` aims to stand out because of some very specific choices.

- Does not intend to replace `ls`. `pls`, as a command, is just as easy to type.
- Targets a more tech-savvy audience in its [features](#features).
- Intelligently [maps file type](src/pls/data/README.md). Just comparing the file extension would be too generic.
- Meticulously chosen iconography for the appreciating eyes.
- Highly customisable at a project level using a simple [`.pls.yml`](.pls.yml) file.
- Built in a friendly language, Python. This makes it easy to fork and change it yourself.
