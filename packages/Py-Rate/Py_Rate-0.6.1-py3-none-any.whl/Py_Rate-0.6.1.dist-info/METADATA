PyRate is a Python tool for estimating the average displacement rate (velocity) and cumulative displacement time-series of surface movements for every pixel in a stack of geocoded unwrapped interferograms generated by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. PyRate uses a "Small Baseline Subset" (SBAS) processing strategy and currently supports input data in the GAMMA or ROI_PAC software formats.
Additionally, the European Space Agency `SNAP software <https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/>`_ version 8 has a "PyRate export" capability that prepares SNAP output data in the GAMMA format for use with PyRate.

The PyRate project started in 2012 as a partial Python translation of "Pirate", a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong University of Technology.

The full PyRate documentation is available at http://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/PyRate

- Fix bugs in the implementation of spatial and temporal filters in the APS module.
- Fix bug in the application of reference phase subtraction that resulted in NaNs in the reference window.
- Fix file handling behaviour in ``prepifg`` so that a large number of files are not left open.

Changed
+++++++
- Enabled multi-looking and parallel processing for the independent orbital method.
- Simplify output filenames produced by PyRate.
- Move output files to dedicated named sub-directories. 
- Use of the ``offset`` parameter in orbital module; now renamed to ``intercept``.

- Change units of temporal filter from years to days.
- Moved Continuous Integration from Travis service to GitHub Actions.
- Made MPI an optional system dependency for PyRate (previously required).

Removed
+++++++
- Remove unused cython, glob2 and pillow dependencies.
- Remove support for Python 3.6.
- Remove support for filter types other than Gaussian in the APS module, and associated config options ``slpfmethod``, ``slpforder``, ``tlpfmethod``.
- ``config`` module deprecated; functionality moved to ``configuration``, ``shared`` and ``constants`` modules.
- Deprecated ``obs_dir``, ``slc_dir`` and ``coh_file_dir`` configuration parameters.

0.5.0 (2020-09-08)
------------------
Added
+++++
- New functionality "``linear_rate``" to calculate linear regression of
  cumulative displacement time series for every pixel as part of the ``timeseries`` step.
- Script for plotting ``timeseries`` and ``linear_rate`` output geotiff products using Matplotlib.
  To use, additional dependencies listed in ``requirements-plot.txt`` are required.
- Correction data (except ``maxvar`` and ``vcmt``) applied to the ifg data is saved to disk
  and re-used on subsequent repeat runs. Corrections are only re-calculated if config
  parameters change between runs.
- MPI parallelisation of APS spatio-temporal filter correction.
- Unit test coverage for refpixel lat/lon to x/y conversion and ``aps`` module.

Fixed
+++++
- Re-enable ``ifglksx`` and ``ifglksy`` to be different values, resulting in different
  resolutions in x and y dimensions in multi-looked interferograms.
- Re-enable ``orbfitlksx`` and ``orbfitlksy`` to be different values, resulting in different
  resolutions in x and y dimensions during network orbit correction.
- Screen messages from main process only during MPI runs.

Changed
+++++++
- ``process`` step has been renamed ``correct``. Stacking and timeseries have been removed from
  this step and are now invoked by separate ``timeseries`` and ``stack`` command line options.
- Processing of coherence files by ``conv2tif`` and ``prepifg`` is now triggered by the presence
  of ``cohfilelist`` in the config file. If the list is present, multilooked/cropped coherence
  files are saved to disk, regardless of whether ``cohmask`` is 0 or 1.
- Parallelisation capability is refactored - MPI and multiprocessing both now use a common
  tiling framework for ``stack``, ``timeseries`` and ``mst`` algorithms.
- Introduced a simplified and standardised file naming format for files produced by the
  ``prepifg`` step. Information previously saved in the filename (e.g. ``ifglksx``, ``ifglksy``,
  and ``ifgcropopt`` values) is now saved to the geotiff header instead.

Removed
+++++++
- Redundant ``tscal`` config parameter was deprecated - not needed now there is a ``timeseries``
  step invokable on the command line.
- Unused ``Pillow``, ``cython`` and ``glob2`` dependencies.
- Deprecated function ``pyrate.prepifg_helper.prepare_ifgs``, which is no longer needed.

------------------
Added
+++++
- Ability to define the order of steps in the ``process`` workflow
  (default order unchanged).

Fixed
+++++
- Nil

Changed
+++++++
- ``prepifg`` output interferograms are saved as read-only files.
- ``process`` makes a writable copy of the ``prepifg`` output data
  at the beginning of each run.
- The selected reference pixel is saved to disk and re-used on subsequent
  ``process`` runs.  
- Saving of incremental time series (``tsincr``) products is optional,
  controlled by the ``savetsincr`` configuration parameter (default is on).

Removed
+++++++
- Removed obsolete InSAR terminology from code, docs and test data
  (changed to `first` and `second` images).
- Stopped using ``unittest`` unit test framework in favour of exclusively
  using ``pytest``.

0.4.2 (2020-06-26)
------------------
Added
+++++
- Save full-res coherence files to disk in ``conv2tif`` step if ``cohmask = 1``.
- Save multi-looked coherence files to disk in ``prepifg`` step if ``cohmask = 1``.
- Additional ``DATA_TYPE`` geotiff header metadata for above coherence files.
- ``conv2tif`` and ``prepifg`` output files have a tag applied to filename dependent
  on data type, i.e. ``_ifg.tif``, ``_coh.tif``, ``_dem.tif``.
- Metadata about used reference pixel is added to interferogram geotiff headers:
  lat/lon and x/y values; mean and standard deviation of reference window samples.
- Quicklook PNG and KML files are generated for the ``Stack Rate`` error map by default.

Fixed
+++++
- Ensure ``prepifg`` treats input data files as `read only`.
- Fix the way that the reference phase is subtracted from interferograms
  during ``process`` step.
- Manual entry of ``refx/y`` converted to type ``int``.

Changed
+++++++
- User supplies latitude and longitude values when specifying a reference pixel in
  the config file. Pixel x/y values are calculated and used internally.
- Move ``Stack Rate`` masking to a standalone function ``pyrate.core.stack.mask_rate``,
  applied during the ``merge`` step and add unit tests.
- Skip ``Stack Rate`` masking if threshold parameter ``maxsig = 0``.
- Provide log message indicating the percentage of pixels masked by 
  ``pyrate.core.stack.mask_rate``.
- Refactor ``pyrate.core.stack`` module; expose two functions in documentation:
  i) single pixel stacking algorithm, and
  ii) loop function for processing full ifg array.
- Refactor ``pyrate.merge`` script; remove duplicated code and create reusable
  generic functions.
- Colourmap used to render quicklook PNG images is calculated from min/max values of
  the geotiff band.
- Updated ``test`` and ``dev`` requirements.

Removed
+++++++
- Deprecate unused functions in ``pyrate.core.config`` and corresponding tests.
- Static colourmap ``utils/colourmap.txt`` that was previously used to render
  quicklook PNG images is removed.

  specify ``rows`` and ``cols`` in the configuration file.
- Improvements to the test suite, including systems-wide tests.
- Improved logging.

Fixed
+++++
- Fixed bug in resampling/multi-looking when coherence masking is used.
  This bugfix will result in significantly fewer ``nan`` pixels in the outputs.

- ``Linear Rate`` algorithm has been renamed ``Stack Rate``.
- User supplies full paths to input files in respective file lists.
- All files generated by `PyRate` saved to user-defined ``outdir`` directory.
- Renamed ``slcfilelist`` parameter to ``hdrfilelist``.
- Log files are generated in the ``outdir`` and every `PyRate` step produces independent log files.

Removed
+++++++
- Deprecate the use of ``obsdir``, ``slcfiledir`` and ``cohdir`` configuration variables.
- Deprecate ``parallel = 2`` option; splitting image via rows for parallelisation.
