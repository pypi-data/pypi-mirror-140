# djangoldp-stripe

A DjangoLDP package supporting Stripe payments. Uses dependency [dj-stripe](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe) to achieve much of the functionality, a library for handling Stripe payments in Django

# Requirements

* djangoldp 2.1
* Python 3.6.5

* Requires the installation of a [DjangoLDP server](https://docs.startinblox.com/import_documentation/djangoldp_guide/install-djangoldp-server.html)

* You will need to set up a [Stripe client](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard)

# Installation

* You will need to set the following settings to your settings.yml:

```yaml
dependencies:
   # ...
   - djangoldp-stripe

ldp_packages:
   # ...
   - djangoldp_stripe

server:
   # ...
   STRIPE_LIVE_MODE: True  # Should be False when testing, True in production
   DJSTRIPE_USE_NATIVE_JSONFIELD: True  # if using SQLite, set this to False
   DJSTRIPE_FOREIGN_KEY_TO_FIELD: "id"
```

* Set `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY` in your OS environment variables where the server is run. These settings will then be securely imported when you next configure. Alternatively, you can add them to the settings.yml:

```yaml
server:
    # ...
    STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY: ""
    STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY: ""
```

You can find these settings via the [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)

* Optionally you can change the setting `LDP_STRIPE_URL_PATH` to change the path where Django Stripe's urls will be accessible. By default it is `"stripe/"`, i.e. `http://localhost:8080/stripe/`. These urls are provided by [DjStripe](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/blob/master/djstripe/urls.py) and implement all of the necessary webhooks to keep your Stripe data sync'ed with your Django data

* In the Stripe dashboard, register a [webhook](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) listening to all events (or just those you want to keep up-to-date) and point them to your API url + your webhook endpoint. So if your API was hosted on `https://yoursite.com/` and you didn't change the `LDP_STRIPE_URL_PATH`, then the endpoint would be `https://yoursite.com/stripe/webhooks/`

* In the created webhooks, find your webhook secret, and set this in the OS variable (or server setting) `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. It is a string which will start `whsec_`

* Optionally add `djangoldp_stripe.middleware.StripeSubscriptionRequiredMiddleware` to your `MIDDLEWARE` settings in `settings.yml`. Use this middleware if you want every request to your application (excluding to the django admin site) to require the user to be subscribed to any product lookup keys included in the setting `PERMS_REQUIRED_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_GLOBALLY`. This setting will also need to be included, e.g.

```yaml
server:
   # ...
   MIDDLEWARE:
     - "djangoldp_stripe.middleware.StripeSubscriptionRequiredMiddleware"
   PERMS_REQUIRED_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_GLOBALLY:
     - "prod_xxxx"
```

Note that this middleware does not check that an anonymous user is subscribed. To prevent this being a problem, make sure that your server does not give anonymous users permissions that they shouldn't have, so that they must login before accessing the application

Add the path of all views which should not be controlled to `EXCLUDE_FROM_GLOBAL_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQ` (e.g. a subscription payment page). The subscription payment pages and the admin are excluded regardless

```yaml
server:
   # ...
   EXCLUDE_FROM_GLOBAL_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQ:
     - '/my-custom-path/'
```

* Run `djangoldp install`

* Run `djangoldp configure`

* Run `python manage.py djstripe_sync_models`. Anytime you run this command your database will be manually synchronised with your Stripe records. If for example your site went down for a time, you should re-run this command

## Migrating existing customers

After configuration, you can do this by running:

```
djangoldp configure
python manage.py djstripe_init_customers
python manage.py djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe
```

# StripeSubscriptionPermissions

This package can be used to provide custom permissions on your models and views. To do this you can use the permissions class `StripeSubscriptionPermissions` or the utility functions in `permissions.py`

* Set up the required product permissions on your model:

```python
class MyModel(Model):
    # ...

    class Meta(Model.Meta):
       # ...
       PERMS_REQUIRED_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTIONS = ['prod_xxxx',]
```

When applying either the permission class to a `LDPViewSet` or the utility function, you can now control access based on the products a requesting user is subscribed to
