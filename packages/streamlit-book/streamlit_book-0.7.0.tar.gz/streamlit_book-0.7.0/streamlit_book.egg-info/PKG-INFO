        Create a file that references the folder with the files you want to render as a book:
        
        ```python
        import streamlit as st
        import streamlit_book as stb
        
        # Streamlit properties
        st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="My page title")
        
        # Streamit book properties
        stb.set_book_config(path="my/path")
        ```
