econpizza
=========

    :target: https://badge.fury.io/py/econpizza

Contains tools to simulate nonlinear perfect foresight models. The baseline mechanism is a Fair-Taylor-like stacking method similar to the nonlinear solver in dynare, but faster and more robust.

The package makes heavy use of `automatic differentiation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation>`_ via `jax <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html>`_!

Installation
-------------

It's as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install econpizza

Documentation
-------------

There is some `documentation <https://econpizza.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ out there.


Citation
--------

**econpizza** is developed by Gregor Boehl to simulate nonlinear perfect foresight models. Please cite it with

    }


I appreciate citations for **econpizza** because it helps me to find out how people have been using the package and it motivates further work.
