### ❖ TheSeptaTimes

TheSeptaTimes is a python package designed to make accessing info about Septa's regional rail network easier. I made this because I commute to college every day via septa, and checking the time for the next train via the app or the website simply takes too much time. I wanted something I could access from my terminal, and thus, TheSeptaTimes was born.
