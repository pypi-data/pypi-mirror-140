Terminology
===========

All of the following terms are valid in the context of a specific Wordle.

* A set of **known letters** is a set of letters which are known to be present in the Wordle's word based on clues obtained from the previous attempts.
* A set of **valid words** at any given point refers to a set of words from vocabulary that are possible solutions to the Wordle at that point based on the clues obtained till then.
* A letter is said to **cover** a word if the letter belongs to that word.
* **Coverage** *(absolute)* of a word refers to the percentage of valid words (at that point) covered by the letters in that word.
* **Coverage** *(relative)* of a word refers to the percentage of valid words (at that point) covered by the set of

Solver
======

WordleSolver roughly uses the following strategy,

* Guess a word with highest (relative) coverage.
* After each guess, eliminate words based on the clues, e.g.,
    * Remove all words that contain an `incorrect-letter`
    * Remove all words that do not contain the identified `(correct-letter, correct-position)` combinations
    * Remove all words that contain the identified `(correct-letter, incorrect-position)` combinations
    * Remove all words that do not contain a `correct-letter`
    * Re-calculate (relative) coverage and guess again
* If at any point, number of valid words drops below number of attempts left, guess the valid words one-by-one.
* Additionally, there are heuristics to choose a word if multiple words with best coverage-score exist.

Helper
======

Helper mode can be used to get assistance while solving Wordle from another provider.

* Suggestions for words will be provided at each step.
* You may choose a word and obtain result.
* Enter the obtained result as a ternary string,
  i.e., a string made of 0, 1, and 2.
  - 0 : (grey)   : an incorrect letter.
  - 1 : (yellow) : a correct letter in wrong position.
  - 2 : (green)  : a correct letter in correct position.
  e.g., if the third letter turned green and fifth letter turned yellow in the third party Wordle, then you should input 00201 as the result obtained.
