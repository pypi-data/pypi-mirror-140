***********************
Introduction to ExoMole
***********************

Meet **ExoMole**, a creature that feeds on data and meta-data files of the
ExoMol_ database.
The ``exomole`` package provides code for parsing, validation and access to the ExoMol
meta-data and data.
The package is primarily aimed at ExoMol database developers and maintainers, as most of
the features require access to the ExoMol files. The code therefore works the best if
installed directly on the ExoMol server.
Nevertheless, several features of the package are also relevant from outside the ExoMol
production server, tapping into the ExoMol public API defined in the database
`release paper`_.

Installation:
=============

The ``exomole`` package can be installed either from PyPI_

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install exomole

or from the GitHub_ page

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/hanicinecm/exomole.git

Package:
========

The code in the package is organised into several modules. The ``read_all`` and
``read_def`` modules contain functionality for parsing, validation and analysis of the
ExoMole's *.all* and *.def* meta-data files, while the ``read_data`` module groups
functionality for reading and validating the *.states* and *.trans* data files.

The documentation_ describes some examples of usage of the package. For further
documentation, refer to the codebase docstrings.


For Developers:
===============
It goes without saying that any development should be done in a clean virtual
environment.
After cloning or forking the project from its GitHub_ page, ``exomole`` can be
installed into the virtual environment in the editable mode by running

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .[dev]

The ``[dev]`` extra installs (apart from the package dependencies) also several
development-related packages, such as ``pytest``, ``black``, ``tox`` or ``ipython.``
The tests can then be executed by running (from the project root directory)

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest

The project does not have the ``requirements.txt`` file by design, as all the package
dependencies are rather handled by the ``setup.py``.
The package therefore needs to be installed locally to run the tests, which grants the
testing process another layer of usefulness.

Docstrings in the project adhere to the numpydoc_ styling.
The project code is formatted by ``black``.
Always make sure to format your code before submitting a pull request, by running
``black`` on all your python files.
