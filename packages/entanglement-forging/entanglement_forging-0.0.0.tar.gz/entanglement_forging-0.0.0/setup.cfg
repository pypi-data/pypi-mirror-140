description = Simulate chemical and physical systems using entanglement forging.
long_description = This module allows a user to simulate chemical and physical systems using a variational quantum eigensolver enhanced by entanglement forging. Entanglement forging doubles the size of the system that can be exactly simulated on a fixed set of quantum bits.
keywords = quantum, nature, simulation
