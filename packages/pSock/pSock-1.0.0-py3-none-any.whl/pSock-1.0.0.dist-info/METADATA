# pSock



pSock is a socket / threading module that helps developers and students to approach Server-Client creation and much more.



Developed by Andrea Vaccaro from ANDRVV (c) 2022



# Installing



Linux, MacOS = ```pip3 install pSock```



Windows = ```pip install pSock```



# How To Create a Server



```python

import pSock



def ToRunOnlyInConnection():

    print("This is a server!")

    print(f"Active connections {sock.getactiveconnections}")

    while True:

        reiceved = sock.take(codify = "utf-8", buffer = 16)

        # The take function receives the entire message in a loop

        print(reiceved)

    sock.quit()





ip, port = "localhost", 80



sock = pSock.pSock(pSock.AF_INET, pSock.SOCK_STREAM)

sock.createserver([ip, port])

sock.start(ToRunOnlyInConnection(), ToListen = 1)

```



# How To Create a Client



```python

import pSock



ip, port = "localhost", 80



sock = pSock.pSock(pSock.AF_INET, pSock.SOCK_STREAM)

sock.connect([ip, port])



print("This is a client!")

while True:

    tosend = input("> ")

    sock.send(tosend, codify = "utf-8")

sock.quit()

```



# Other Commands And Methods



Receive host, address and active connections



```python

import pSock



ip, port = "localhost", 80



sock = pSock.pSock(pSock.AF_INET, pSock.SOCK_STREAM)

sock.createserver([ip, port])



host = sock.gethost

addr = sock.getaddr

active_connections = sock.getactiveconnections

```



Sending without connections



```python

import pSock



ip, port = "localhost", 80



sock = pSock.pSock(pSock.AF_INET, pSock.SOCK_STREAM)



tosend = input("> ")



sock.sendto(tosend, codify = "utf-8", ["localhost", 80])

```



Setting a temporary addr



```python

import pSock



ip, port = "localhost", 80



sock = pSock.pSock(pSock.AF_INET, pSock.SOCK_STREAM)



tosend = input("> ")



sock.setaddr(["localhost", 80])

sock.sendto(tosend, codify = "utf-8")



tosend = input("> ")



sock.setaddr(["localhost", 334])

sock.sendto(tosend, codify = "utf-8")



sock.setaddr(["localhost", 334])

sock.createserver()



sock.cancelsets() # To delete the IP and ports set

```
