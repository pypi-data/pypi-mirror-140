Quick and Easy Stock Portfolio Analysis - FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!!

### Note
I use Docker for enviroment management; as such, my build process will deviate from more classical approaches. 

```
docker build -f ./container/dockerfile . -t stockeasy:develop
docker run -it stockeasy:develop
```
