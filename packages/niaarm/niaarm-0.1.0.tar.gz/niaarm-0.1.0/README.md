## General outline of the framework
NiaARM is a framework for Association Rule Mining based on nature-inspired algorithms for optimization. The framework is written fully in Python and runs on all platforms. NiaARM allows users to preprocess the data in a transaction database automatically, to search for association rules and provide a pretty output of the rules found. This framework also supports numerical and real-valued types of attributes besides the categorical ones. Mining the association rules is defined as an optimization problem, and solved using the nature-inspired algorithms that come from the related framework called [NiaPy](https://github.com/NiaOrg/NiaPy).

## Detailed insights
The current version witholds (but is not limited to) the following functions:

- loading datasets in CSV format,
- preprocessing of data,
- searching for association rules,
- providing output of mined association rules,
- generating statistics about mined association rules.

## Installation

### pip3

Install NiaARM with pip3:

```sh
pip3 install niaarm
```
