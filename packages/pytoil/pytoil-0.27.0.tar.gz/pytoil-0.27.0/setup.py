It\'s primarily aimed at python developers but you could easily use it to manage any project!\n\npytoil is:\n\n* Easy to use ✅\n* Easy to configure ✅\n* Safe (it won\'t edit your repos at all) ✅\n* Snappy (it\'s asynchronous from the ground up and as much as possible is done concurrently, clone all your repos in seconds!) 💨\n* Useful! (I hope 😃)\n\nSay goodbye to janky bash scripts 👋🏻\n\n## Background\n\nLike many developers I suspect, I quickly became bored of typing repeated commands to manage my projects, create virtual environments, install packages, fire off `cURL` snippets to check if I had a certain repo etc.\n\nSo I wrote some shell functions to do some of this for me...\n\nAnd these shell functions grew and grew and grew.\n\nUntil one day I saw that the file I kept these functions in was over 1000 lines of bash (a lot of `printf`\'s so it wasn\'t all logic but still). And 1000 lines of bash is *waaaay* too much!\n\nAnd because I\'d basically hacked it all together, it was **very** fragile. If a part of a function failed, it would just carry on and wreak havoc! I\'d have to do `rm -rf all_my_projects`... I mean careful forensic investigation to fix it.\n\nSo I decided to make a robust CLI with the proper error handling and testability of python, and here it is! 🎉\n\n## Installation\n\nAs pytoil is a CLI program, I\'d recommend installing with [pipx].\n\n![pipx-install](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/pipx_install.svg)\n\nYou can always fall back to pip\n\n![pip-install](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/pip_install.svg)\n\npytoil will install everything it needs *in python* to work. However, it\'s full feature set can only be accessed if you have the following external dependencies:\n\n* [git]\n* [conda] (if you work with conda environments)\n* [VSCode] (if you want to use pytoil to automatically open your projects for you)\n* [poetry] (if you want to create poetry environments)\n* [flit] (if you want to create flit environments)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n`pytoil` is super easy to get started with.\n\nAfter you install pytoil, the first time you run it you\'ll get something like this.\n\n![setup](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/setup.svg)\n\nIf you say yes, pytoil will walk you through a few questions and fill out your config file with the values you enter. If you\'d rather not do this interactively, just say no and it will instead put a default config file in the right place for you to edit later.\n\nOnce you\'ve configured it properly, you can do things like...\n\n#### See your local and remote projects\n\n![show-local](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/show_local.svg)\n\n#### See which ones you have on GitHub, but not on your computer\n\n![show-diff](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/show_diff.svg)\n\n#### Easily grab a project, regardless of where it is\n\nThis project is available on your local machine...\n\n![checkout-local](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/checkout_local.svg)\n\nThis one is on GitHub...\n\n![checkout-remote](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/checkout_remote.svg)\n\n#### Create a new project and virtual environment in one go\n\n![new-venv](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/new_venv.svg)\n\n(And include custom packages, see the [docs])\n\n#### And even do this from a [cookiecutter] template\n\n![new-cookie](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/new_cookie.svg)\n\nAnd loads more!\n\npytoil\'s CLI is designed such that if you don\'t specify any arguments, it won\'t do anything! just show you the `--help`. This is called being a \'well behaved\' unix command line tool.\n\nThis is true for any subcommand of pytoil so you won\'t accidentally break anything if you don\'t specify arguments 🎉\n\nAnd if you get truly stuck, you can quickly open pytoil\'s documentation with:\n\n![docs](https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pytoil/raw/main/docs/img/docs.svg)\n\nCheck out the [docs] for more 💥\n\n## Contributing\n\n`pytoil` is an open source project and, as such, welcomes contributions of all kinds 😃\n\nYour best bet is to check out the [contributing guide] in the docs!\n\n[pipx]: https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/\n[docs]: https://FollowTheProcess.github.io/pytoil/\n[FollowTheProcess/poetry_pypackage]: https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/poetry_pypackage\n[wasabi]: https://github.com/ines/wasabi\n[httpx]: https://www.python-httpx.org\n[async-click]: https://github.com/python-trio/asyncclick\n[contributing guide]: https://followtheprocess.github.io/pytoil/contributing/contributing.html\n[git]: https://git-scm.com\n[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/\n[VSCode]: https://code.visualstudio.com\n[config]: config.md\n[cookiecutter]: https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter\n[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org\n[flit]: https://flit.readthedocs.io\n',
