# WLabKit
**This is a toolkit to handle bio-data from WeiBin Lab.**

Similar data processing tasks occur frequently in my daily work though these tasks are not complicated. To avoid change the code repeatedly, I set up this project for the convenience of laboratory members and others.



## Installation

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI) and on Conda.

Before installing wlabkit, make sure the dependency packages are installed.
```shell
pip install numpy biopython pandas
```
Then, you can run (At present, only pip installing is allowed):
```shell
conda install wlabkit
```
```shell
pip install wlabkit
```



### Latest version: 0.0.16

⚠️***Attention:  Only the latest version has all the functions*** 



## Help

Get help information, you can run:
```shell
wlabkit -h
```

If you want to get help information of subcommand, you can run:
```shell
wlabkit [subcommand] -h
```



## Subcommands

Subcommands are as follows. You can run the following command, and the relevant files are in the `test_data` folder.



- ***getseq***

get target sequences from a header list.

examples:
```shell
wlabkit getseq -i search.fasta -l header.txt -o target.fasta
```




- ***antismash_getdir***

get gbk file dir of target BGC type from an antiSMASH result folder.

examples:

```shell
# analyse only one antiSMASH result folder
wlabkit antismash_getdir -i GCF_000466165.1.zip -t 'lassopeptide'
```

```shell
# analyse multiple antiSMASH result folders
for f in `ls *.zip`; do wlabkit antismash_getdir -i $f -t target.list >> target.txt; done
```



- ***gbk2fasta***

convert one or more gbk files to specified fasta files.

examples:

```shell
# convert a gbk file to a fasta file
wlabkit gbk2fasta -i region001.gbk -o region001.fasta
```

```shell
# convert multiple gbk files to a fasta file
wlabkit gbk2fasta -i gbk -o gbk.fasta -m

# convert multiple gbk files to corresponding fasta files
wlabkit gbk2fasta -i gbk -o fasta  # fasta is a folder path
```
