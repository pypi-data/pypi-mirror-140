Type: Package.

Title: TOPSIS method for multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM).

Version: 1.0.0.

Description: Evaluation of alternatives based on multiple criteria using TOPSIS method.

What is TOPSIS?
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) originated in the 1980s as a multi-criteria decision making method. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.


How to install this package : 
pip install Topsis-Prateek-101916078

In Command Prompt : 
python topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+,+" result.csv



Input file (data.csv)
The decision matrix should be constructed with each row representing a Model alternative, and each column representing a criterion like Accuracy, R2, Root Mean Squared Error, Correlation, and many more. The file should be put in the command line as the location of the file.

| M8        | 0.8  | 0.64 | 4.8 | 67.4 |  18.41 |

Weights (weights) is not already normalised will be normalised later in the code.

Information of benefit positive(+) or negative(-) impact criteria should be provided in impacts.
