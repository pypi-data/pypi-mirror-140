    With the PyExperimenter user can create a function that run one single experiment (we call this function `own_function`, but any function name is possible). The experiment itself,
    which is defined by its parameters, is then automatically executed by passing the parameters to the `own_function` and writing the
    results in a database. Errors that occur during execution are also captured by the PyExperimenter and written to the database.
