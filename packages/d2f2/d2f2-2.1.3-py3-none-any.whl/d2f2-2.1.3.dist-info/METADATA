# d2f2 2.1.3

*d2f2* is a tool written in Python to convert image folders into files.

## Installation

You can install (and update) *d2f2* from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/d2f2) via the command line

```commandline
pip install d2f2 -U
```

or use one of the standalone versions (see below).

## Usage

### Operation modes

*d2f2* offers two modes of operation: "single" and "batch".

#### Single mode

The standard mode, converts each given directory into a file.

```commandline
d2f2 /a/path /another/path ...
```

#### Batch mode

Useful for converting big batches of folders, this mode converts each subdirectory within the given directories into a file. To use it, add the ``-b``/``--batch`` option to the command:

```commandline
d2f2 -b /a/path /another/path ...
```

### Output format

By default, *d2f2* saves files in the PDF format. If you want to use another supported format, use the ``-f``/``--format`` option:

```commandline
d2f2 /a/path ... -f FORMAT
```

Currently, there are 2 supported formats (with more to be added in the future). Use the appropriate format as the FORMAT parameter:

* [PDF] - Portable Document Format (_default_)
* [CBZ] - Comic Book Format, ZIP-compressed

### Output path

By standard, *d2f2* saves files to the current directory. If you want another output path, use the ``-o``/``--output`` option:

```commandline
d2f2 /a/path ... -o /an/output/path 
```

### Sorting mode

By default, *d2f2* sorts the images in alphanumeric, ascending order (A-Z). If you want to use another sorting mode you can specify one by using the ``-s``/``--sort`` option:

```commandline
d2f2 /a/path ... -s MODE
```

Currently, there are 6 sorting modes available. Use the corresponding number from the following list as the MODE parameter:

* [ 1] Alphanumeric, ascending (_default_)
* [-1] Alphanumeric, descending
* [ 2] Last time modified, oldest first
* [-2] Last time modified, newest first
* [ 3] Time of creation / metadata change, oldest first
* [-3] Time of creation / metadata change, newest first

## Shell

*d2f2* offers an interactive shell including all functions of the normal *d2f2* CLI tool.

Standalone versions for the shell are available for Windows and Linux (see [Releases](https://github.com/DomCie/D2F2/releases))

You can also start the shell from the command line:

```commandline
d2f2 --shell
```

## TODO

* More output formats (EPUB, MOBI)
* Custom order for images
* Modify names of output files
* Standalone GUI client
