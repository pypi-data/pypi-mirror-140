/**
 * A struct for device information.
 * There were types that we could have used enums instead of using those int values as the results.
 * However I am trying not to use enums with cython since it is bit complicated.
 * This I will be representing all those values which enums as int values.
 * Device Type are as it follows:
 * Mouse = 0,
 * Keyboard = 1,
 * Headset = 2,
 * MouseMat = 3,
 * HeadsetStand = 4,
 * Cooler = 5,
 * MemoryModule = 6,
 * Motherboard = 7,
 * GPU = 8,
 * ETC = 9,
 * ALL = 10
 *
 * The SDK brand is as it follows:
 * Razer = 0,
 * CorsairSDK = 1
