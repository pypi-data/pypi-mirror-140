        TopsisPy is a Python Package implementing Topsis method used for multi-criteria decision analysis. Topsis stands for 'Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution'.
        
        TopsisPy intends to make the process of TOPSIS simple in python. Key features of the package are -
        
        Easy to use
        Numpy based
        Ideal for Students

        > > > from divjyot.topsis import topsis
        > > > a =[
        > > > ... [250, 16, 12, 5],
        > > > ... [200, 16, 8, 3],
        > > > ... [300, 32, 16, 4],
        > > > ... [275, 32, 8, 4],
        > > > ... [225, 16, 16, 2]
        > > > ... ]
        > > > w = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
        > > > sign = [-1, 1, 1, 1]
        > > > tp.topsis(a, w, sign)
        > > > Or
        > > > You may use the Package via commandline as -
        
        $ python [package name] [path of csv as string] [list of weights as string] [list of sign as string]
        Here, as string means using " "
        
        This will return a tuple with
        
        1.the index of winning data point
        2.array containing scores of all data points As for above -
        (2, array([0.53427686, 0.30836777, 0.69163223, 0.53473658, 0.40104612]))
