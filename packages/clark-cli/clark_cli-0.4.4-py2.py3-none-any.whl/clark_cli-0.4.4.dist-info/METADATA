# About

This repository contains the Command Line Client (CLI) for Clark which was produced by [Elio.earth](https://www.elio.earth/).
We aim to simpify researcher's documentation and execution processes with Clark. The CLI is a tool which researchers
use to document their workflows. This enables the researcher to definitively understand the end-to-end process of their
research and creates a system of record with versioning for their research (similar to Github).

# Pre-requisites

- Linux or MacOS
- Python 3.x
- **MacOS only**: *sudo* access to your machine (We use [DTrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace) to trace system calls)

# Install

The CLI is available from PyPI.

```bash
pip install clark-cli
```

# Use

Below is a basic usage example from start to finish.


### Register
Sign-up for an account at https://www.clarknest.com/register.

*Remember to check your email to confirm your account. You will need to confirm your account before using the CLI.*

**Once you are registered, and you have confirmed your account** you will be ready to issue commands with the CLI.

### Create a Workflow

First login to the CLI using the credentials you registered with.

```bash
clark login
```

To view all the possible commands run:

```bash
clark --help
```

The next step is to create directories and workflows. Just like a filesystem, you can organize your workflows into directories.
You initially start with an empty *virtual* filesystem.

Create a directory in the root folder (post login you always start in the root of your *virtual* filesystem)

```bash
clark add directory projectA
```

Change into the directory you just created.

```bash
clark cd projectA
```

Now you are ready to execute a script.

```bash
clark upload --message "A message to attach to this version of your workflow" python my_script.py
```

The CLI will run your script and auto-detect the inputs and outputs of the script. You will be asked to
confirm the inputs and outputs before they are stored in the workflow. We upload the inputs, outputs and script to
our servers.

If you made a mistake you can re-run the workflow and "replace" the previous run of the script.

```bash
clark upload --message "A different message for this run" --replace python my_script.py
```

Don't worry, you will have access to both versions of your workflow in the UI (described below). We create a version for each
upload.

You can then go to another directory or workflow. You can back out of the workflow by:

```bash
clark cd ..
```

### View a Workflow

You can then go to the [Clark Nest](https://www.clarknest.com/login) to view your workflows, add notes to the nodes or workflows.


### Examples

There some execution examples in the examples folder.
