class DiffConvert:
    """This abstract class handles converting the difference between an
    old ('from') configuration item to the corresponding new ('to')
    configuration item.

    The main difference process will use deepops.deepdiff() to work out
    what has been removed and what updated (added/changed) between the
    two configurations.

    Individual differences are checked using child classes, which
    specify the part of the configuration directionaries where they
    occur and the remove() and update() methods called.  For example, if
    the hostname is changed, a 'hostname' converter would specify the
    part of the configuration dictionary where the hostname is stored
    and the update() method would return the commands required to change
    it to the new value.

    The 'context', 'cmd' and 'ext' parameters, below, are all tuples
    giving parts of the path through the keys of the configuration
    dictionary to match for the specific converter.  These can be
    literal keys, or the value None, if that level of the path is a
    wildcard match for all keys - for example, '("interface", None)' to
    match all interfaces.  The part of the configuration dictionary
    that matches the 'context + cmd' parts of the path will be passed
    as the 'old/new' and 'rem/upd' parameters to the action methods.

    The child classes can override the following values:

    context -- the path to the context containing the commands used in
    this conversion: if this context is removed in its entirety, the
    remove() action for this converter will not be called as the
    removal of the context will remove it; this variable defaults to
    the empty tuple, for a command at the top level

    cmd -- the path for this command in the configuration, following
    the context; this part of the dictionary will be passed in the
    'old/new' and 'rem/upd' parameters to the action methods; this
    variable defaults to None and must be defined by a child class

    ext -- an extension to path which must be matched, but this part is
    not used to further specify the part of the dictionaries passed to
    the action functions for the 'old/new' and 'rem/upd' parameters:
    this is useful when a higher level in the configuration dictionary
    is required in the action function

    block -- the block of configuration in which this converter is to be
    applied (see DiffConfig)

    insert_before -- if this rule needs to happen prior to the actions
    of another rule, this 2-tuple gives the (path, name) before the
    earlier rule; None means the order does not matter

    In addition the remove() and update() methods will likely need to be
    implemented.
