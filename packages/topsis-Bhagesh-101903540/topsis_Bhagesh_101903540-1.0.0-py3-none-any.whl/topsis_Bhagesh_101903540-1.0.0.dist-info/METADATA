# Topsis-Bhaegesh-10193540

This package is implementation of topsis technique of multi-criteria decision analysis. This package will accept three parameters as input:


1. .csv file which contains the models and parameters
2. string of weights separated by commas(,)
3. string of requirements (+/-) separated by commas(,) 

It performs the topsis, calculate the Performance
Score and Rank according to the inputs and store them in the output file.
This program must be run through command line only.
### What is TOPSIS
The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method.
TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS)
and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).
### Installation 
To install this module write the following line in the command prompt.

```pip install Topsis-Bhagesh-101903540```
### How to use this 

Topsis-Bhagesh-101903540 can be run as in the following example:

####In Command Prompt

``` >> topsis data.csv "1,1,1,1" "+,+,-,+"```

###Example on the Dataset

####Input File

| Moblie | Price($) | Storage(GB) | Camera(MP) | Rating |   
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| `M1`   | 250      | 16          | 12         | 5      |
| `M2`   | 200      | 16          | 8          | 3      |
| `M3`   | 300      | 32          | 16         | 4      |
| `M4`   | 275      | 32          | 8          | 4      |
| `M5`   | 225      | 16          | 16         | 2      |

In addition to input file we provide impact and weight for each columns from 2nd to last column. Impact must be +ve or -ve.
Weight and Impact must be seperated with commans.

####Output File
The output file is steuctured as follows

| Moblie | Price($) | Storage(GB) | Camera(MP) | Rating | Topsis Score | Rank| 
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| `M1`   | 0.11     | 0.08        | 0.11       | 0.15   |0.53|3|
| `M2`   | 0.09     | 0.08        | 0.07       | 0.09   |0.31|5|
| `M3`   | 0.13     | 0.15        | 0.14       | 0.12   |0.69|1|
| `M4`   | 0.12     | 0.15        | 0.07       | 0.12   |0.53|2|
| `M5`   | 0.1      | 0.08        | 0.14       | 0.06   |0.40|4|

For calulating Rank it compare upto six decimal digits but display only upto two decimal points.
The rankings are displayed in the form of a table using a package 'tabulate', with the 1st rank offering us the best decision, and last rank offering the worst decision making, according to TOPSIS method.
