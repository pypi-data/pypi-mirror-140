        ## Introduction
        
        It was on March 11, 2020 that the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus pandemic. During this same period, Italy was the main focus and then the USA took the place. In March 17, 2020 many countries in Africa was closed borders and banning flights from elsewhere.  **Covid19outbreak** is a single-player simulator strategy board game. Player start with 10 lifes and priority is to save all patients. 
        
        ## Object of the game
        
        By looking for the way to save patient, player must avoid Sars-Cov II and keep its life. If he save all patients player wins otherwise the game begins very difficult.
        
        ## Gameplay
        
        During the game, player must be stratege by finding a plant and avoiding Sars-CovII in their way. If player touches viruse and have a plant, he kill viruse. If player touches viruse without a plant, he looses some percentage of life and he contaminates environment. Patient is  unstable due to collision with viruses. 
        
        # Rule
        
        ## Starting-positions
        
        Player starts in bottom of screen with 5 virus, 7 patients and 5 plants.
        
        ## Moves
        
        Players can move following theses directions:
        
        - **Up, Left, Right, Down**
        
        - **LeftTop, RightTop,  LeftBottom, RightBottom, NOOP**
        
        # Environment
        
        ## Observation
        
        The observation is a numpy arrays of size (480, 520, 3). This arrays is a dtype=np.uint8 value in the [0, 255] range. You can see image below.

        ## Actions
        
        The moves is the 8 directions mentioned before. Player can go everywhere in the screen to reach his objective.

        </p>
        <em>agent can move Up, Left, Right, Down, LeftTop, RightTop,  LeftBottom, RightBottom in the screen.</em>
        
        ## Reward
        
        Player have four rewards:
        
        1. If boy hits a plant: **reward = 1 + number of plant collected + 0.01** during an episode.
        
        2. If boy saves a patient: **reward = 1 + number of patient saved** during an episode.
        
        3. If boy hits Sars-Cov II with a plant: **reward = number of plant + 0.01 - 2**, 0.01 is a decay life.
        
        4. If boy hits Sars-Cov II without having a plant: **reward = - 3 - 0.01**.
        
        In beginning of game, player have 10 lifes by hitting the viruse without a plant, life = life - 1.
        
        Do not forget that player can contaminate environment by creating two viruses each time after infection.
        
        ## Episode termination
        
        The episode is terminated if agent looses all its life or saves all patients or kills all viruses.
