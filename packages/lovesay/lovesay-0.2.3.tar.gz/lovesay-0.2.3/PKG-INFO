---

### ❖ Requirements 

- A quotes file stored in `$HOME/.config/lovesay/`
- Each quote must be on a new line, see the example quotes file in `.config/lovesay/quotes`
- (optional) A partner to write you 31 lines full of love, one for each day of the month

---

### ❖ Installation

> Install from pip
```sh
$ pip3 install lovesay
```

> Install from source
- First, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ZenithDS/lovesay.git
$ cd lovesay
$ poetry build
$ pip3 install ./dist/lovesay-0.2.3.tar.gz
```

### ❖ Usage 

lovesay can be used with a variety of different color schemes.

> lovesay uses [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) as it's default color scheme, but a different one can be specified using a positional argument. 

For example:
```sh
$ lovesay # uses catppuccin
```
  
```sh
$ lovesay nord # uses nord 
```

Supported color schemes as of now: 
- [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)
- [nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord)
- [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
- [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)
- [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
- [rose pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/)
- [ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme)
- [palenight](https://github.com/drewtempelmeyer/palenight.vim)
- [gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh)

by default, lovesay checks for the quotes file at `$HOME/.config/lovesay/quotes` if there is nothing there, it will just print out a heart with no quote

### ❖ About lovesay

I wrote lovesay because I got tired of seeing neofetch or pfetch every time I opened my terminal. I wanted something more personal. 

Seeing words full of love from my partner is a lot better than any other command I could possibly run. It makes my terminal feel cozy, welcoming, and as is the case with most things my partner touches, it makes my terminal feel like home. 

I hope that someone else finds a use for this little script as well. Love is a wonderful thing, and we could all use a little bit more of it in our lives (especially arch linux users)
