The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision analysis method, which was originally developed by Ching-Lai Hwang and Yoon in 1981[1] with further developments by Yoon in 1987,[2] and Hwang, Lai and Liu in 1993.[3] TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS)[4] and the longest geometric distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS).
