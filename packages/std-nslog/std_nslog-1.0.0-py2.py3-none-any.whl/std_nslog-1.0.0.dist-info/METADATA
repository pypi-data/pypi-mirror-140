std-nslog is a shim that redirects stderr/stdout to the Apple System Log (NSLog).
This can be useful when deploying Python code as a standalone app on macOS or
iOS.

Usage
-----

std-nslog primary exists as a utility for std-nslog deployments. You shouldn't ever need
to install it yourself. However, just in case...

To install std-nslog::

    $ pip install std-nslog

Then, in your code, ``import nslog``. This will install the shim. The file
only needs to be imported once; preferably as early as possible in the

Once installed, all output written to stdout and stderr will be redirected to the Apple
System Log.

Why no pun?
-----------

While an obscure joke referencing apples and logs might be amusing, it would make
no sense when it appeared in a std-nslog requirements file.
