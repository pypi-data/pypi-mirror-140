    def retrieve_application(self, id: str, include: str) -> LockstepResponse:
        """
        Retrieves the Application with this identifier.

        An Application represents a feature available to customers
        within the Lockstep Platform. You can create Applications by
        working with your Lockstep business development manager and
        publish them on the platform so that customers can browse and
        find your Application on the Lockstep Platform Marketplace. When
        a customer adds an Application to their account, they obtain an
        AppEnrollment which represents that customer's instance of this
        Application. The customer-specific AppEnrollment contains a
        customer's configuration data for the Application, which is not
        customer-specific.

        See [Applications and Enrollments](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/applications-and-enrollments)
        for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------

    def update_application(self, id: str, body: object) -> LockstepResponse:
        """
        Updates an existing Application with the information supplied to
        this PATCH call.

        The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the
        object while leaving other values alone. As input you should
        supply a list of field names and new values. For example, you
        can provide the field name "IsActive" and specify the new value
        "False"; this API will then change the value of IsActive to
        false.
