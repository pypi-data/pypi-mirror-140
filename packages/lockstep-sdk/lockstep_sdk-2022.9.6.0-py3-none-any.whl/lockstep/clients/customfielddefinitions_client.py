        Retrieves the Custom Field Definition specified by this unique
        identifier.

        A Custom Field represents metadata added to an object within the
        Lockstep Platform. Lockstep provides a core definition for each
        object. The core definition is intended to represent a level of
        compatibility that provides support across most accounting
        systems and products. When a user or developer requires
        information beyond this core definition, you can use Custom
        Fields to represent this information.

        See [Extensibility](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/extensibility)
        for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        id : str

            elements to retrieve. No additional data collections are
            currently defined on this object, but may be supported in
            the future.

        """
        Updates an existing Custom Field Definition with the information
        supplied to this PATCH call.

        The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the
        object while leaving other values alone. As input you should
        supply a list of field names and new values. If you do not
        provide the name of a field, that field will remain unchanged.
        This allows you to ensure that you are only updating the
        specific fields desired.
