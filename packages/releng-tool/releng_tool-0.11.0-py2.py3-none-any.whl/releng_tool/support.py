def require_version(version, quiet=False, critical=True):
    """
    perform a required-version check

    Enables a caller to explicitly check for a required releng-tool version.
    Invoking this function with a dotted-separated ``version`` string, the
    string will be parsed and compared with the running releng-tool version.
    If the required version is met, this method will have no effect. In the
    event that the required version is not met, the exception ``SystemExit``
    will be raised if the critical flag is set; otherwise this call will
    return ``False``.

    An example when using in the context of script helpers is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        # ensure we are using releng-tool v1
        releng_require_version('1.0.0')

    Args:
        version: dotted-separated version string
        quiet (optional): whether or not to suppress output
        critical (optional): whether or not to stop execution on failure

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the version check is met; ``False`` if the version check
        has failed

    Raises:
        SystemExit: if the version check fails with ``critical=True``
