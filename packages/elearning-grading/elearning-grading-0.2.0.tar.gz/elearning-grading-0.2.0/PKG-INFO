# eLearning Grading
## Python utilities to help Teaching Assistants grade assignments with eLearning

______________________________________________________________________

## eLearning Grading

This repository contains python scripts and tools to help Teaching Assistants
using eLearning's assignment download feature to organize and grade written, typed, and programming assignments.

## How To Use
### Installing from pip
```bash
pip install elearning-grading
```

### Installing from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Supermaxman/elearning-grading
cd elearning-grading
pip install -e .
```

### Extracting code and reports from .zip file
eLearning provides the `Assignment File Download` feature for Teaching Assistants to download assignment files 
for the entire class. 
Sadly, this feature makes grading assignments extremely tedious, 
as the .zip file provided usually looks like this:
```bash
TODO
```

## About Me
My name is [Maxwell Weinzierl](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~maxwell.weinzierl/), and I am a
Natural Language Processing researcher at the Human Technology Research Institute (HLTRI) at the
University of Texas at Dallas. I am currently working on my PhD, which focuses on COVID-19 and
HPV vaccine misinformation, trust, and more on Social Media platforms such as Twitter. I am 
also a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the AI, NLP, and IR classes of Dr. Harabagiu.
