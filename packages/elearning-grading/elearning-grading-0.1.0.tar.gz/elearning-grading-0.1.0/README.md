## eLearning Grading

This repository contains python scripts and tools to help Teaching Assistants
using eLearning's assignment download feature to organize and grade written, typed, and programming assignments.

## How To Use
### Installing from pip
```bash
pip install elearning-grading
```

### Installing from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Supermaxman/elearning-grading
cd elearning-grading
pip install -e .
```

### Extracting code and reports from .zip file
eLearning provides the `Assignment File Download` feature for Teaching Assistants to download assignment files 
for the entire class. 
Sadly, this feature makes grading assignments extremely tedious, 
as the .zip file provided usually looks like this:
```bash
TODO
```
