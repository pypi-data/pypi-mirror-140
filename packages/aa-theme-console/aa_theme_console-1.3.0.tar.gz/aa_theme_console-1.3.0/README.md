# Alliance Auth Theme: Console

The perfect theme for all old school console nerds out there :-)

![AA Theme: Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ppfeufer/aa-theme-console/master/aa_theme_console/images/aa-theme-console.jpg)

## Installation

```shell
pip install aa-theme-console
```

Now open your `local.py` and add the following right below your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
# Console Thame - https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-theme-console
INSTALLED_APPS.insert(0, "aa_theme_console")
```

**Important**

If you are using `AA-GDPR`, the template stuff needs to be **after** the `AA_GDPR`
entry, like this:

```python
# GDPR Compliance
INSTALLED_APPS.insert(0, "aagdpr")
AVOID_CDN = True


# Console Thame - https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-theme-console
INSTALLED_APPS.insert(0, "aa_theme_console")
```
