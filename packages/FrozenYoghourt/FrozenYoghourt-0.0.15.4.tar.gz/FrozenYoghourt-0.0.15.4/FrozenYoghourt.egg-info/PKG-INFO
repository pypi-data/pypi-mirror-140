# FrozenYoghourt

FrozenYoghourt is a collections of useful modules for working with circuit theory. Our library offers a tool for both numerical calculation with numpy that is optimized for speed and symbolic manipulation with sympy that is helpful for studying closed form circuit.

We divide our library into 4 main modules.

1. mode: used for switching between numerical and symbolic representations.
2. gates: contains many useful one and two qubits gates. The symbolic representation are especially conducive to analyzing parameterized families.
3. maths: this module contains many mathematical methods that are generally useful for quantum computing
4. quantum: this module contains specific methods for working with circuit decomposition
5. circuit: we are developing this module to optimize matrix multiplication and tensor product in the context of quantum circuits. This should also allows for easy analysis of quantum state and isometry.
6. visualization: this module contains methods for visualization data using both 2d plots and 3d plots
