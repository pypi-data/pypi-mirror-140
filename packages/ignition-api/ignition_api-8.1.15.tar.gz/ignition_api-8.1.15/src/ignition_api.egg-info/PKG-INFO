        #### Installation and usage
        
        To use Ignition, you may install it by doing any of the following.
        
        ##### Installing with `pip`
        
        The preferred method is to install it by running `pip`. It requires Python 2.7.18.
        
        ```bash
        python2 -m pip install ignition-api
        ```
        
        This will install it as package to your Python installation, which will allow you to call Ignition Scripting functions from Python's REPL, and get code completion using an IDE (we recommend PyCharm).
        
        ```bash
        $ python2
        Python 2.7.18 (default, Nov  9 2020, 16:23:15) 
        [GCC Apple LLVM 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.21)] on darwin
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> from __future__ import print_function
        >>> import system.util
        >>> print(system.util.__doc__)
        Utility Functions.
        
        The following functions give you access to view various Gateway and
        Client data, as well as interact with other various systems.
        
        >>> system.util.beep()
        >>> quit()
        ```
        
        And to uninstall:
        
        ```bash
        python2 -m pip uninstall ignition-api
        ```
