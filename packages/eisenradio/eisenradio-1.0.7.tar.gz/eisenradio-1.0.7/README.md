Eisenradio - a Web radio expandable collection
---
 * Organize your web radios; delete and update, backup and restore
 * Freedom: Style your app with pictures, import a poem, song text, or a funny comment to have a good time
 * Cool feature: Create a shuffled playlist within a local audio files folder in seconds
 * More action: A ping variable shows the response time and a spectrum analyser the frequency range 
 * Speed: Travel through the app at breakneck speed, thanks to the smart design of the controls 
 * Android: download to mobile (link below .-apk), rename *WHL to *ZIP, extract with Android _file_ manager
 * https://pypi.org/project/eisenradio-apk/

Eisenradio - the boring details 
---
 * A REST API app on blueprints and application factory of the flask framework with a SQLite database
 * Eisenradio is the first Internet Radio App that can run a Spectrum Analyser in a Web Browser (Feb,2022)
 * Kill the browser window - streams for listen and rec will be up; Kill the terminal - communication stops
 * Eisenradio uses its own API and adjusts the buffer size for a given bit rate
 * Backup and restore are easy work with the help of an optional exported *ini file
 * Eisenradio uses Pythons sys.path; it will find its modules on the dark side of the moon
 * The Android APK Package uses Python Kivy for multi-touch and promotes us to "foreground service" (not get killed)
 * Eisenradio process can run on one processor only, due to the (extensive) use of Pythons Multithreading
 * Backend (server) opens the connection, buffers the incoming stream and presents it to the browsers internal net
 * Frontend (browser) controls the backend, plays internet and local audio and has a spectrum analyser at your disposal
