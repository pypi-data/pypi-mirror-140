# TOPSIS
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is a multi-criteria decision making method. The method is based on finding an ideal and an anti-ideal solution and comparing the distance of each one of the alternatives to those. TOPSIS chooses the alternative of shortest Euclidean distance from the ideal solution, and greatest distance from the negative-ideal solution.
