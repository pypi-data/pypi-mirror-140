Convert a date written as text in a certain way to a datetime object.

## How to use it :computer:
First you install it in you environment like this
```bash
pip install textime
```
Then you can start using it already! Pass any string to the `text` parameter containing a date in the format: "`DAY` of `MONTH` of `YEAR`" where `YEAR` must be written out completely, like "first of May of two thousand and twenty one" or "second of August of one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine".
```python
from datetime import datetime

from textime import textime


text_to_dt: datetime = textime.to_datetime(text="Fifteenth of July of two thousand and eight")
```
