"""
These are events dispatched by Discord. This is intended as a reference so you know what data to expect for each event.

??? Hint "Example Usage:"
    The event classes outlined here are in `CamelCase` to comply with Class naming convention, however the event names
    are actually in `lower_case_with_underscores` so your listeners should be named as following:

    ```python
    @listen()
    def on_ready():
        # ready events pass no data, so dont have params
        print("Im ready!")

    @listen()
    def on_guild_join(event):
        # guild_create events pass a guild object, expect a single param
        print(f"{event.guild.name} created")
    ```
!!! warning
    While all of these events are documented, not all of them are used, currently.
