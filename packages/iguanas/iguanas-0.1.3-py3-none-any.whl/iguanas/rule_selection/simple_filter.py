    Filter rules based on a metric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    threshold : float
        The threshold at which the rules are filtered.
    operator : str
        The operator used to filter the rules. Can be one of the following: 
        '>', '>=', '<', '<='
    metric : Callable
        The method/function which calculates the metric by which the rules are
        filtered.    
    rules : Rules, optional
        An Iguanas `Rules` object containing the rules that need to be 
        filtered. If provided, the rules within the object will be filtered. 
        Defaults to None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rules_to_keep : List[str]
        List of rules which remain after the filter has been applied.
    rules : Rules
        The Iguanas `Rules` object containing the rules which remain after the
        filter has been applied.
