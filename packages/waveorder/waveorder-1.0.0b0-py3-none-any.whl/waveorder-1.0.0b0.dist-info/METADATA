# waveorder
This package enables wave optical simulations and deconvolution of optical properties that report microscopic architectural order. 

This vectorial wave simulator/reconstructor enabled development of a new label-free imaging method, __uniaxial permittivity tensor imaging (uPTI)__, that reconstructs density (phase) and 3D anisotropy (principal retardance, 3D orientation of the optic axis, and optic sign) of specimens from polarization-resolved images acquired with multiple oblique illuminations.

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of uPTI are described in the following [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422951):

``` L.-H. Yeh, I. E. Ivanov, B. B. Chhun, S.-M. Guo, E. Hashemi, J. R. Byrum, J. A. Pérez-Bermejo, H. Wang, Y. Yu, P. G. Kazansky, B. R. Conklin, M. H. Han, and S. B. Mehta, "uPTI: uniaxial permittivity tensor imaging of intrinsic density and anisotropy," bioRxiv 2020.12.15.422951 (2020).```

Please cite above paper if you use or adapt this code.

uPTI provides reconstruction of phase, principal retardance, 3D orientation, and optic sign from a polarization-diverse and illumination-diverse acquisition. Following figure summarizes how the acquisition and reconstructions work with simulated images and reconstructed uPTI data using `waveorder`: 

![Data_flow](Fig_Readme.png)

When the acquisition is polarization-diverse, illumination-diverse, and depth-diverse, `waveorder` can reconstruct the above measurements across volume. 

In addition to uPTI, `waveorder` also enables simulations and reconstructions of subsets of label-free measurements with subsets of acquired dimensions. 

1. Reconstruction of 2D/3D phase, projected retardance, and in-plane orientation from a brightfield, polarization-diverse, and depth-diverse acquisition ([QLIPP](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502))

2. Reconstruction of 2D/3D phase from a brightfield, depth-diverse acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-54-28-8566)/[3D (PODT)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-57-1-a205) phase)
    
3. Reconstruction 2D/3D phase from an illumination-diverse and depth-diverse acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-23-9-11394&id=315599)/[3D](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-10-3940&id=349951) differential phase contrast)
       

Currently, the [example](examples/) notebooks contain simulations for 2D QLIPP, 3D PODT, and 2D/3D uPTI. There is also a notebook demonstrating the reconstruction of the experimental data of 3D uPTI (data will be uploaded soon).

## Installation

### Create a new conda environment
Install conda package management system by installing anaconda or miniconda ([link](https://conda.io/)). 

1) Creating a conda environment dedicated to `waveorder` will avoid version conflicts among packages required by `waveorder` and packages required by other python software.
>```buildoutcfg
>conda create -n <your-environment-name> python=3.7
>conda activate <your-environment-name> (or source activate <your-environment-name>)
>```

2) Then, install jupyter notebook with
>```buildoutcfg
>conda install jupyter
>```
    
### Install `waveorder` and required packages
Install the git version control system git : [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

1) Use git to clone this repository to your current directory:
>```buildoutcfg
>git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
>```

2) Then, you can install dependencies via pip (python index package) <br>
  
>    If you are running waveorder on your own machine, <br>
>
>    a) navigate to the cloned repository:
>
>    ```buildoutcfg
>    cd waveorder
>    ```
>    <br>
>    b) install python library dependencies:
>
>    ```buildoutcfg
>    pip install -r requirements.txt
>    ```
>    <br>

3) Create a symbolic library link with setup.py:
>
>```buildoutcfg
>python setup.py develop
>```

The installation time is less than 10 minutes on a normal desktop computer.

*`waveorder` supports NVIDIA GPU computation through cupy package, please follow [here](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for installation (check cupy is properly installed by ```import cupy```). To enable gpu processing, set ```use_gpu=True``` when initializing the simulator/reconstructor class.*


## Usage and example

In the following, we demonstrate how to run `waveorder` for simulation and reconstruction. <br>

1) In the terminal, switch to the environment with waveorder installed 
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  conda activate <your-environment-name>
>  ```

2) Navigate to the repository folder:
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  cd waveorder/example
>  ```

3) Open jupyter notebook or lab to run the simulation/reconstruction notebook in the folder:
>  ```buildoutcfg
>  jupyter notebook
>  ```
We recommend installing `cupy` before running uPTI simulation because uPTI computation takes up more resources. 3D uPTI simulation with array size of (200, 200, 100) takes 20 minutes and the reconstruction of the same-size array takes 10 minutes on a NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU.
