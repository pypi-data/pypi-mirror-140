## Usage

This tool can be used for simulating quantum circuits provided in any of the following formats:
* `Real` from [RevLib](http://revlib.org/documentation.php)
  * [Our set of circuits](https://github.com/cda-tum/quantum_circuits)
  * [RevLib](http://revlib.org)
* `OpenQASM` used by IBM's [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit)
  * [Our set of circuits](https://github.com/cda-tum/quantum_circuits)
  * [OpenQASM Repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm)
  * [QUEKO](https://github.com/tbcdebug/QUEKO-benchmark) (focus on mapping though)
* `GRCS`
  * [GRCS Repo](https://github.com/sboixo/GRCS)
* `TFC`
  * [Reversible Logic Synthesis Benchmarks Page](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~dmaslov/mach-read.html)
* Qiskit QuantumCircuits
  * As a backend for qiskit
  * "Standalone" by directly passing the quantum circuit


The format is automatically detected through the file extension.


The following additional algorithms are integrated in [QFR](https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr.git) and hence available in the simulator as well:
* Quantum Fourier Transformation
* Bernstein-Vazirani
* GHZ / Entanglement
* Grover's search (see `--help` for different call options)

For details on the available methods we refer to [iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_simulation](https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_simulation).

The simulator is based on the references listed below and can either be used as a **standalone executable** with command-line interface, or as a **library** for the incorporation in other projects.

## Using the Python Bindings / Backend for Qiskit

The backend for Qiskit is available via [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.ddsim/) as wheel for Linux, Windows and MacOS.
In order to make the library as easy to use as possible (without compilation), we provide pre-built wheels for most common platforms (64-bit Linux, MacOS, Windows). (We strongly recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).)

```console
(venv) $ pip install mqt.ddsim
```

However, in order to get the best performance out of DDSIM, it is recommended to build it locally from the source distribution via
```console
(venv) $ pip install --no-binary mqt.ddsim mqt.ddsim
```

The following code gives an example on the usage:

```python3
from qiskit import *
from mqt import ddsim

circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
circ.h(0)
circ.cx(0, 1)
circ.cx(0, 2)

print(circ.draw(fold=-1))

provider = ddsim.MQTProvider()

backend = provider.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

job = execute(circ, backend, shots=10000)
result = job.result()

counts = result.get_counts(circ)
print(counts)
```

The provider currently has seven backends:

* `qasm_simulator` which simulates the circuit and returns the requested number of shots
* `statevector_simulator` which also simulates the circuit and returns the statevector along the requested number of shots
* `hybrid_qasm_simulator` which simulates the circuit in parallel using a hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman technique and returns the requested number of shots
* `hybrid_statevector_simulator` which also simulates the circuit in parallel using a hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman technique and returns the statevector
* `path_sim_qasm_simulator` which allows to exploit arbitrary simulation paths for the simulation of the circuit and returns the requested number of shots
* `path_sim_statevector_simulator` which also allows to exploit arbitrary simulation paths and returns the statevector along the requested number of shots
* `unitary_simulator` which constructs the unitary functionality of a circuit and returns the corresponding unitary matrix

A slightly more elaborate example can be found in the notebook [ddsim.ipynb](ddsim.ipynb).

## System Requirements

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, MacOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments). However, the implementation should be compatible
with any current C++ compiler supporting C++17 and a minimum CMake version of 3.14.

`OpenMP >= 4.0` is required for building the `ddsim` library. The `ddsim_noise_aware` simulator further requires `Threads::Threads`.

## Clone, Build, and Run

The code uses quite a few submodules, which have to be initialized.
There are two ways to do this:

1. While cloning the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` option to `git clone`. For HTTPS access: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cda-tum/ddsim/`.
2. After cloning with `git submodule update --init --recursive`.


### Library

For building the library alone the CMake target `ddsim` is available.
In CMake from version 3.13 you can use the following commands:
```console
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim
```

Windows users need to configure CMake by calling

```console
$ cmake -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim
```

instead.

The library can be used by including, for example, the ``QFRSimulator.hpp`` header file and
```c++
std::string file1 = "PATH_TO_FILE_1.EXT";
qc::QuantumComputation qc1(file1);

qc::SimpleSimulator sim(qc1);
sim.Simulate();
auto samples = sim.MeasureAllNonCollapsing(1000);
/* Use the results */
```

### Executable Simulator

To build the executable simulator, build the `ddsim_simple` CMake target and run the resulting executable with options according to your needs.

The standalone executable is launched in the following way, showing available options:
```console
$ ./ddsim_simple --help
JKQ DDSIM by https://iic.jku.at/eda/ -- Allowed options:
-h [ --help ]                         produce help message

--simulate_shor_coprime arg (=0)      coprime number to use with Shor's algorithm (zero randomly generates a coprime)
--simulate_shor_no_emulation          Force Shor simulator to do modular exponentiation instead of using emulation (you'll usually want emulation)
--simulate_fast_shor arg              simulate Shor's algorithm factoring this number with intermediate measurements
--simulate_fast_shor_coprime arg (=0) coprime number to use with Shor's algorithm (zero randomly generates a coprime)
```


The output is JSON-formatted as shown below (with hopefully intuitive naming).

```console
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim_simple
$ ./build/ddsim_simple --simulate_ghz 4 --shots 1000 --ps --pm

#### Quickstart Guide

Execute the following lines to get the simulator running in no time:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cda-tum/ddsim/
[...]

$ cd ddsim

ddsim/ $ cmake -S . -B build
-- Build files have been written to: /.../build

ddsim/ $ cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim_simple
[...]
[100%] Built target ddsim_simple

ddsim/ $ build/ddsim_simple --help                            
JKQ DDSIM by https://iic.jku.at/eda/ -- Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                         produce help message
[...]
```

From here on you can start simulating quantum circuits or run the integrated algorithms.

### Executable Noise-aware Simulator

The tool also supports noise-aware quantum circuit simulation, based on a stochastic approach. It currently supports
global decoherence and gate error noise effects. A detailed summary of the simulator is presented
in [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05620). Note that the simulator currently does not support simulating the integrated
algorithms.

Building the simulator requires `Threads::Threads`. It can be built by executing

```console
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim_noise_aware
```

The simulator provides a help function which is called in the following way:

```console
$ ./build/ddsim_noise_aware -h
JKQ DDSIM by https://iic.jku.at/eda/ -- Allowed options:
  -h [ --help ]                         produce help message
  --seed arg (=0)                       seed for random number generator (default zero is possibly directly used as seed!)
  --pm                                  print measurements
  --ps                                  print simulation stats (applied gates, sim. time, and maximal size of the DD)
  --verbose                             Causes some simulators to print additional information to STDERR
  --simulate_file arg                   simulate a quantum circuit given by file (detection by the file extension)
  --step_fidelity arg (=1)              target fidelity for each approximation run (>=1 = disable approximation)
  --steps arg (=1)                      number of approximation steps
  --noise_effects arg (=APD)            Noise effects (A (=amplitude damping),D (=depolarization),P (=phase flip)) in the form of a character string describing the noise effects
  --noise_prob arg (=0.001)             Probability for applying noise
  --confidence arg (=0.05)              Confidence in the error bound of the stochastic simulation
  --error_bound arg (=0.1)              Error bound of the stochastic simulation
  --stoch_runs arg (=0)                 Number of stochastic runs. When the value is 0 the value is calculated using the confidence, error_bound and number of tracked properties.
  --properties arg (=-3-1000)           Comma separated list of tracked properties. Note that -1 is the fidelity and "-" can be used to specify a range.

Process finished with exit code 0

```

An example run, with amplitude damping, phase flip, and depolarization error (each with a probability of 0.1% whenever a gate is applied) looks like this:

```console
$ ./build/ddsim_noise_aware --ps --noise_effects APD --stoch_runs 10000 --noise_prob 0.001 --simulate_file adder4.qasm
{
  "statistics": {
    "applied_gates": 23,
    "approximation_runs": "0.000000",
    "benchmark": "stoch_APD_adder_n4",
    "final_fidelity": "0.937343",
    "max_nodes": 10,
    "mean_stoch_run_time": "0.015796",
    "n_qubits": 4,
    "parallel_instances": "28",
    "perfect_run_time": "0.000066",
    "seed": "0",

    "stoch_runs": 10000,
    "stoch_wall_time": "5.911118",
    "threads": 28
  }
}
```

### Simulation Path Framework

The tool also provides a framework for exploiting arbitrary simulation paths (using the [taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow) library) based on the methods proposed in [[6]](https://iic.jku.at/files/eda/2022_date_exploiting_arbitrary_paths_simulation_quantum_circuits_decision_diagrams.pdf). 
A *simulation path* describes the order in which the individual MxV or MxM multiplications are conducted during the simulation of a quantum circuit.
It can be described as a list of tuples that identify the individual states/operations to be multiplied.
The initial state is always assigned `ID 0`, while the i-th operation is assigned `ID i`.
The result of a multiplication is assigned the next highest, unused ID, e.g., in a circuit with `n` gates the result of the first multiplication is assigned `ID n+1`.

The framework comes with several pre-defined simulation path strategies:
 
 - `sequential` (*default*): simulate the circuit sequentially from left to right using only MxV multiplications
 - `pairwise_recursive`: recursively group pairs of states and operations to form a binary tree of MxV/MxM multiplications
 - `bracket`: group certain number of operations according to a given `bracket_size`
 - `alternating`: start the simulation in the middle of the circuit and alternate between applications of gates "from the left" and "from the right" (which might potentially be useful for equivalence checking) 
 
 as well as the option to translate strategies from the domain of tensor networks to decision diagrams (using the [CoTenGra](https://github.com/jcmgray/cotengra) library), see [here](#cotengra).

#### Basic Example

This example shall serve as a showcase on how to use the simulation path framework (via Python).
First, create the circuit to be simulated using qiskit, e.g., in this case a three-qubit GHZ state:

```python
from qiskit import *

circ = QuantumCircuit(3)
# the initial state corresponds to ID 0
circ.h(0)         # corresponds to ID 1
circ.cx(0, 1)     # corresponds to ID 2
circ.cx(0, 2)     # corresponds to ID 3
```

Then, obtain the simulation path framework qiskit backend. You can choose between the `path_sim_qasm_simulator` and the `path_sim_statevector_simulator`. The first just yields a dictionary with the counts of the measurements, while the latter also provides the complete statevector (which, depending on the amount of qubits, might not fit in the available memory).

```python
from mqt import ddsim

provider = ddsim.JKQProvider()
backend = provider.get_backend('path_sim_qasm_simulator')
```

Per default, the backend uses the `sequential` strategy. For this particular example, this means: 
 - first, the Hadamard operation is applied to the initial state (`[0, 1] -> 4`)
 - then, the first CNOT is applied (`[4, 2] -> 5`)
 - finally, the last CNOT is applied (`[5, 3] -> 6`)

 The corresponding simulation path is thus described by `[[0, 1], [4, 2], [5, 3]]` and the final state is the one with ID `6`.

The simulation is started by calling the `execute` function, which takes several optional configuration parameters (such as the simulation path strategy). For a complete list of configuration options see [here](#configuration).

```python
job = execute(circ, backend)
result = job.result()

counts = result.get_counts(circ)
print(counts)
```

#### CoTenGra

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, the framework allows to translate strategies from the domain of tensor networks to decision diagrams.
To this end, the tensor network contraction library [CoTenGra](https://github.com/jcmgray/cotengra) is used.
In order to use this part of the framework, some extra dependencies have to be installed. This can be accomplished by running
```console
pip install jkq.ddsim[tnflow]
pip install -U git+https://github.com/jcmgray/cotengra.git
```

Then, in order to let CoTenGra determine a simulation path for a given circuit the `mode="cotengra"` option has to be used when calling `execute`, i.e.,
```python
job = execute(circ, backend, mode="cotengra")
```
Per default this uses a maximum of `60s` (option `cotengra_max_time`) and `1024` trials (option `cotengra_max_repeats`) for CoTenGra and dumps a representation of the determined simulation path to a file in the current working directory (option `cotengra_dump_path`).
Optionally, a visualization of the simulation path can be generated by specifying `cotengra_plot_ring=True`.

#### Configuration

The framework can be configured using multiple options (which can be passed to the `execute` function):
 - `mode`: the simulation path mode to use (**`sequential`**, `pairwise_recursive`, `bracket`, `alternating`, `cotengra`))
 - `bracket_size`: the bracket size used for the `bracket` mode (default: *`2`*)
 - `alternating_start`: the id of the operation to start with in the `alternating` mode (default: *`0`*)
 - `seed`: the random seed used for the simulator (default *`0`*, i.e., no particular seed)

In addition to the above, CoTenGra can be configured using the options described [above](#cotengra).

## Running Tests

The repository also includes some (rudimentary) unit tests (using GoogleTest), which aim to ensure the correct behavior
of the tool. They can be built and executed in the following way:

```console
$ cmake -DBUILD_DDSIM_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build/ --config Release
$ ./build/test/ddsim_test
[...]
```

## Frequently Asked Questions


**Why does generation step of CMake fail?**

If you see the following error message
```console
$ cmake -S . -B <build target directory>
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (message):
qfr was not found.  Please init/update submodules (git submodule update --init --recursive) and try again.
```
Please run `git submodule update --init --recursive` and try again.

**Why do I get a linking error at the end of the build process?**

If you are using gcc for building, and you get the error message 
```
lto1: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-9/README.Bugs> for instructions.
