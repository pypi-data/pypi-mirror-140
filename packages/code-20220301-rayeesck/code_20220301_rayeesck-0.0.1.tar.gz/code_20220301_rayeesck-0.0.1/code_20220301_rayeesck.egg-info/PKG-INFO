Description: # BodyMassIndex Calculator
        
        This repository consists of a simple BodyMassIndex calculator using Python.
        
        ## Summary
        
        ### About BodyMassIndex
        
        Body mass index is a value derived using weight and height of a person.
        Formula : - **BodyMassIndex(kg/m2) = mass(kg) / height(m)2**
        
        #### Chart
        
        | Category | Range | Health risk |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | Underweight | 18.4 and below  | Malnutrition risk |
        | Normal weight | 18.5 to 24.9 | Low risk |
        | Overweight | 25 to 29.9 | Enhanced risk |
        | Moderately obese  | 30 to 34.9 | Medium risk |
        | Severely obese  | 35 to 39.9 | High risk |
        | Very severely obese | 40 and above | Very high risk |
        
        ### About Calculator
        
        1. It accepts Json file as input and returns number of overwieght people count (considering all the count above 25 BodyMassIndex) and stores the output as Json/CSV
        2. Output file contains output BodyMassIndex along with Category and Health risk data.
        
        ### Future work
        
        We can returns the people details with approximate weight to be lost or increase to reach normal BodyMassIndex.
        
        ### Install and Run
        
        - Install the module using following command
            ```
                pip install code_20220301_rayeesck
            ```
        - Import the module in your code and call the process with passing the parameters
            ```
                from code_20220301_rayeesck import process
                output = process('InputJsonPath',output_format = 'csv')
            ```
        - ouput will have the number of over weight count and stores the output file in same directory with appending 'output' into the name of file.
        - Parameters
            - InputJsonPath = path of input json file
            - output_format = csv/json, which format output to be stored
