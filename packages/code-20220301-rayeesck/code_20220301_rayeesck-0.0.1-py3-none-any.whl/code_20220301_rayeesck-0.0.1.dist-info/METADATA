# BodyMassIndex Calculator

This repository consists of a simple BodyMassIndex calculator using Python.

## Summary

### About BodyMassIndex

Body mass index is a value derived using weight and height of a person.
Formula : - **BodyMassIndex(kg/m2) = mass(kg) / height(m)2**

#### Chart

| Category | Range | Health risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Underweight | 18.4 and below  | Malnutrition risk |
| Normal weight | 18.5 to 24.9 | Low risk |
| Overweight | 25 to 29.9 | Enhanced risk |
| Moderately obese  | 30 to 34.9 | Medium risk |
| Severely obese  | 35 to 39.9 | High risk |
| Very severely obese | 40 and above | Very high risk |

### About Calculator

1. It accepts Json file as input and returns number of overwieght people count (considering all the count above 25 BodyMassIndex) and stores the output as Json/CSV
2. Output file contains output BodyMassIndex along with Category and Health risk data.

### Future work

We can returns the people details with approximate weight to be lost or increase to reach normal BodyMassIndex.

### Install and Run

- Install the module using following command
    ```
        pip install code_20220301_rayeesck
    ```
- Import the module in your code and call the process with passing the parameters
    ```
        from code_20220301_rayeesck import process
        output = process('InputJsonPath',output_format = 'csv')
    ```
- ouput will have the number of over weight count and stores the output file in same directory with appending 'output' into the name of file.
- Parameters
    - InputJsonPath = path of input json file
    - output_format = csv/json, which format output to be stored
