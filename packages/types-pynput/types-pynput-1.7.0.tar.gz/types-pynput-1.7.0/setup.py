## Typing stubs for pynput

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pynput` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `pynput`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/pynput. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `b55fed42ed4b62a106bbf29c10d5bc6f19a473f6`.
