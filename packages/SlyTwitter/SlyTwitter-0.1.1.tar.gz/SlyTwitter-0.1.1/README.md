This library does not have full coverage.
Version 2 and premium version 1.1 are not supported.

* Reading followers

```python
import asyncio
from SlyTwitter import *

async def main():
    # don't forget to keep your secrets secret!
    app = json.load(open('test/app.json'))
    user = json.load(open('test/user.json'))

    twitter = await Twitter(app, user)

    follow = await twitter.check_follow('dunkyl_', 'TechConnectify')

    print(follow) # @dunkyl_ follows @TechConnectify
    
asyncio.run(main())
```
