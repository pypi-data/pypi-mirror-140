Tools around bluebild@EPFL

## Installation
```
$ pip install bluebild-tools --upgrade
```
## Usage

### Check whether CuPy can be used

```
from bluebild_tools import cupy as bbt_cupy
use_cupy = bbt_cupy.is_cupy_usable()
```

You can set the `MUST_CUPY` environment variable to influence the behavior of the function:
- With `MUST_CUPY` unset or set to 0, the `use_cupy` boolean variable will be set to `False` if CuPy can't be used and set to `True` if CuPy can be used.
- With `MUST_CUPY` set to 1, the process will be killed if CuPy is not usable.
- With `MUST_CUPY` set to 0, no attempt will be made to use CuPy (i.e. `use_cupy` will be set to `False`, always).

## Note
If CuPy is found unusable, the following environment variables are automatically set to 0:
- `CUPY_PYFFS`
- `CUPY_PYLOPS`

That way, the pyFFS (https://github.com/imagingofthings/pyFFS) and PyLops (https://github.com/PyLops/pylops) packages can be imported with CuPy support disabled.
