Description: # Collective Mind (CM or cMind)
        
        The goal of the Collective Mind framework (CM) is to provide the foundation
        to make AI modular, reproducible and easy to use.
        
        CM attempts brings together interdisciplinary teams to exchange their knowledge, 
        experience and best practices about designing, optimizing and deploying AI and ML Systems 
        as a database of reusable artifacts with JSON/YAML meta descriptions, 
        unified automation recipes and portable workflows. 
        
        All automation recipes have a common Python API with unified dictionaries as I/O
        to help abstract and interconnect numerous and previously incompatible 
        software, hardware and data.
        
        Inspired by LEGO(tm), CM framework facilitates collaboration across organizations and companies
        to decompose, asbtract and solve complex problems such as reproducible benchmarking, 
        optimization and deployment of ML Systems by interconnecting, testing and improving
        common automation recipes, artifacts and workflows.
