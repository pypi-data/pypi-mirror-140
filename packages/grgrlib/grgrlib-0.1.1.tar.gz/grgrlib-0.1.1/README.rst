=======

Library of unspeakably useful functions. This is not ready for public use yet.

Installation with ``pip``
-----------------------------

It's as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install econsieve


Installation of bleeding-edge version using ``git``
---------------------------------------------------

The handy way is to first install ``git``. Linux users just use their respective repos. Look into `this repo <https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge/blob/master/README.rst>` for details.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/gboehl/grgrlib

Alternatively you can clone the repository and then from within the cloned folder run (Windows user from the Anaconda Prompt):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .
