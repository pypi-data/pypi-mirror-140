## An unofficial way to interact with your tethered Panasonic Lumix in Python

This is a **very** early package and everything is subject to change. I needed to take pictures through my tethered Panasonic G9 via Python. No one else had done it (as far as I could see), so I'm putting this out there for anyone else who might need to do the exact thing I am doing.

All this package does right now is take pictures through my camera. It might work for your Lumix camera. No promises! I plan on adding to it over time.
