    A state machine representing a complete action to be performed by the robot.

    A robot subsystem.  Subsystems are the basic unit of robot organization in
    the Command-based framework; they encapsulate low-level hardware objects
    (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and provide methods through which they can
    be used by Commands.  Subsystems are used by the CommandScheduler's resource
    management system to ensure multiple robot actions are not "fighting" over
    the same hardware; Commands that use a subsystem should include that
    subsystem in their GetRequirements() method, and resources used within a
    subsystem should generally remain encapsulated and not be shared by other
    parts of the robot.

    Subsystems must be registered with the scheduler with the
    CommandScheduler.RegisterSubsystem() method in order for the
    Periodic() method to be called.  It is recommended that this method be called
    from the constructor of users' Subsystem implementations.  The
    SubsystemBase class offers a simple base for user implementations
    that handles this.
