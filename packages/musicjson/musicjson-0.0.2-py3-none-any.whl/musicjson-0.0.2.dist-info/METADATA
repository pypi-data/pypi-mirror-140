# musicJSON

Author: David WANG

- This runs like a midi player: user writes notes in JSON file and listen it.
- Adjust the sound with your knowledge in synthesis

Although there is musicXML files, which are more professional, musicXML is too complicated for human to read.
## Installation:
```bash
pip install musicjson
```

## Usage:
(1) First, you need to create a JSON file with the following format, and save it in the same folder of your program. Assumed its name is 'music.json'

Or, you can go to get a ready JSON file in my homepage:

https://github.com/DavidWang2AI/musicjson/tree/main/data

* Remarks:

 a) tempo: relative speed

 b) band: how many parts, to be played simultaneously

 c) data: the notes: key name followed by length. To make it readable by human, please try to keep each division in a line.

In the following sample, there are 2 parts to be played at the same time.So the total length in time for each of them is equal.
The key names placed in the same square bracket are chord, ie to be played at the same time.
"O" is the rest.

```python
{
  "tempo": 2.1,
  "band": 2,
  "data": [
    [
      ["A4",0.333],["C5",0.333],["E5",0.334],["A5",0.333],["C6",0.333],["E6",0.334],["D6",0.333],["C6",0.333],["B5",0.334],
      ["A5",0.333],["C6",0.333],["E6",0.334],["A6",0.333],["C7",0.333],["E7",0.334],["D7",0.333],["C7",0.333],["B6",0.334],
      ["a6",0.333],["A6",0.333],["g6",0.334],["G6",0.333],["f6",0.333],["F6",0.334],["E6",0.333],["d6",0.333],["D6",0.334],
      ["c6",0.333],["C6",0.333],["B5",0.334],["a5",0.333],["A5",0.333],["g5",0.334],["G5",0.333],["f5",0.333],["F5",0.334],
      ["E5",0.5],["d5",0.5],["E5",0.5],["B4",0.5],["D5",0.5],["C5",0.5]
    ],
    [
      [["E4","C4","A3"],1],["O",1],[["E4","C4","A3"],1],
      [["E4","C4","A3"],1],["O",1],[["E4","C4","A3"],1],
      [["E4","C4","A3"],1],["O",2],
      ["O",2],["O",1],
      ["O",2],["O",1]
    ]
  ]
}
```

(2) Run the following script to play the notes you composed in JSON file ("music.json for this example"):

```python
from musicjson.band import *

b=Band()
b.play('music.json')
```

If you want to save the music into a wav file:
```python
from musicjson.band import *

b=Band()
b.play('music.json', save=True, savefile='music.wav')
```
